# Distance-vector-routing-protocol

Implemented a simplified version of the Distance Vector routing protocol over simulated routers.Routers are one of the most important elements in any network, responsible for forwarding packets to the next-hop in the network and eventually to their correct destination. To be able to perform this critical task, routers rely on the forwarding table. The forwarding table itself is constructed using the distance vector routing protocol. A routerâ€™s operations are divided into two dimensions: Data Plane and Control Plane.
